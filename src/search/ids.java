// which class should the frontier belong to? Many search algorithms need it, so it can't just belong to ids or to TNode. Maybe I should make a class called LIFO frontier and another one called FIFO frontier? Should I put them in a new class called search>? What about the explored set?
// ids and dfs etc are just different searches. Maybe they should all be in a class called uninformed search.
// but maybe they should all be in a package. What is a package anyway?
// search > uninformed > dls etc.
